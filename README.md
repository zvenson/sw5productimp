Shopware 5 Plugin to import Products from XML File to shopware 5 using sftp connection. 
This Plugin is is quite strongly customized to our individual wishes and can certainly not be used just like that, but can certainly serve as a basis for deriving your own importer
On this basis we have created a product importer for shopware 6 that grabs products from xml file via ssh and imports them to shopware 6. The plugin can be seen in action in this shop. They are offering 
<a href="https://einweggeschirr-bio.de/bio-einweg-geschirr/einwegteller/pappteller">Pappteller</a> and lots of other stuff that is beeing imported with this tool.
Its importing the products on a daily basis and updates prices, description and stuff like that.
